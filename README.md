# Pijersi certu

![](./docs/pijersi-screenshot-with-setup-bis.png)

The Python package *pijersi_certu* provides a GUI and a rules engine for playing the *Pijersi* board-game, which is a *wise men oriented* variant of [*Jersi*](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/jersi) board-game. 

The rules of Pijersi are explained here [https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/pijersi](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/pijersi) in a rulebook (Markdown and PDF formats) and also here in videos in  [English](https://youtu.be/w2c6-h2DAus) or in  [French](https://youtu.be/w41zrhBB5t8) (both with subtitles).

*pijersi_certu* is being developed on Windows and should be portable on Linux. For running it on your computer read the [**INSTALL**](./docs/INSTALL.md) instructions.
