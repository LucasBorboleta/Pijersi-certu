# TODO
The foreseen tasks on pijersi-certu are as follows:

- [ ] Optimize the Minimax weights (maybe according to depth) using some stochastic algorithm; done for Minimax at depths 1, 2 and 3, but not yet for Minimax-4.
- [ ] Complete documentation and information relevant for GitHub publishing (code of conduct, etc.)
