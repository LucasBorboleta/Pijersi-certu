# TODO
The foreseen tasks on pijersi-certu are as follows:

- [ ] Optimize the Minimax weights (maybe according to depth) using some stochastic algorithm.
- [ ] Rework MCTS at fix given depth using Minimax evaluation function as a reward.
- [ ] Complete documentation and information relevant for GitHub publishing (code of conduct, etc.)
